            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Game developers work on teams to plan, design, and produce video games for computers, mobile devices, or game consoles. Their work involves creating visual content for the game and writing code to implement all the game’s features and functionality. This career requires a background in software development and mathematics and the ability to collaborate well with others to accomplish project goals. While many work full-time hours in game studios or at software companies, opportunities exist for game developers who prefer to work remotely or to self-publish their games online as independent developers.

            <h2>Tools/API's</h2>
            <p>The gaming industry has grown tremendously in the recent past. A recent report released by the Entertainment Software Association (ESA) estimated that 42% of Americans play video games for at least 3 hours every week. Additionally, more than 150 million Americans play online and offline video games. Another forecast by PwC suggested that by 2019, the revenue generated from video games would reach $93.18 billion USD. In addition, the global social gaming market would reach $22.52 billion USD. Considering these statistics, you can see why games constitute one of the leading API categories today. Technically, API is an acronym for Application Programming Interface. The term refers to a software interface that allows two applications to communicate with each other. A gaming API allows your programs and software applications to interact with one another and share rules, settings, specifications, and data among others. These APIs interact with libraries, operating systems, applications and more, usually used to share and embedded gaming content. When looking at what API’s to choose, the three main things to take in consideration are functionality, efficacy, and pricing. Here are some of the top API’s out right; EVE ESI API, TwitchTV API, Battle.net API, Steam Web API and many. We encourage you to look into some of these and see what if they fit the game development you are trying to do since they are all different in their own way.</p>
