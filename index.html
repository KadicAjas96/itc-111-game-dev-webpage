      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p><b>Game developers work on teams to plan, design, and produce video games for computers, mobile devices, or game consoles. 
            Their work involves creating visual content for the game and writing code to implement all the game’s features and functionality. 
            This career requires a background in software development and mathematics and the ability to collaborate well with others to 
            accomplish project goals. While many work full-time hours in game studios or at software companies, opportunities exist for game 
            developers who prefer to work remotely or to self-publish their games online as independent developers.</b></p>

      <h4 class="w3-wide w3-center">Tools</h4>
      <p class="w3-opacity w3-center">We’re in the golden age of indie games. Mobile gaming alone made $41 billion in 2016, and indie developers got a hearty piece of 
                    that pie. Digital distribution, an ever-expanding video game audience and the proliferation of powerful computers can be thanked for the indie 
                    game industry’s growth. Without the help of affordable engines and frameworks, however, game devs would be unable to meet the growing demand. 
                    Fortunately, these software tools do exist, and they serve to start the careers of indie dev novices and experts alike.</p>
                    <p <p class="w3-opacity w3-center">Some of the top tools for the indie game developr are Unreal Engine, Unity, Godot Engine and many more. These tools
                    will help you make the process a lot easier and have a lot of great functions that are hard to build from scratch. Visit this website 
                    <a href="https://dzone.com/articles/5-best-video-game-development-tools-for-indie-game" target="_blank" style="color: aquamarine;">Top 5 Video Game Tools</a>
                    to get more information. We reccomend you dig as much as you can to find the right tool for whatever ideas(s) you have.</p>
      <h4 class="w3-wide w3-center">API's</h4>
      <p class="w3-opacity w3-center">The gaming industry has grown tremendously in the recent past. A recent report released by the Entertainment Software Association (ESA)
                    estimated that 42% of Americans play video games for at least 3 hours every week. Additionally, more than 150 million Americans play online 
                    and offline video games. Another forecast by PwC suggested that by 2019, the revenue generated from video games would reach $93.18 billion USD. 
                    In addition, the global social gaming market would reach $22.52 billion USD.</p> 
                    <p class="w3-opacity w3-center">Considering these statistics, you can see why games constitute one of the leading API categories today. Technically, 
                    API is an acronym for Application Programming Interface. The term refers to a software interface that allows two applications to communicate with 
                    each other. A gaming API allows your programs and software applications to interact with one another and share rules, settings, specifications, and
                    data among others. These APIs interact with libraries, operating systems, applications and more, usually used to share and embedded gaming content. 
                    When looking at what API’s to choose, the three main things to take in consideration are functionality, efficacy, and pricing. Here are some of 
                    the top API’s out right; RAWG Video Games Database, Chicken Coop, SteamWeb and many more. We encourage you to look into some of these on here
                     <a href="https://rapidapi.com/blog/top-video-game-apis/" target="_blank" style="color: aquamarine;">Top 9 API's</a> and see what if they fit the 
                     game development you are trying to do since they are all different in their own way.</p>
                                    <br>
        <h4 class="w3-wide w3-center">Languages</h4>
        <p class="w3-opacity w3-center">Picking the right language to develop your game is a very important step to game development. This is going to be the structure of
             your entire project. There are many different programming languages to develop games with some of the main ones are C++, Java, & Python. There are many more 
             but these are some on the most prominent ones. Make sure when you’re choosing which language you’re going to base your game off of that you are confident & fluent in it.

            <p class="w3-opacity w3-center">The Xbox One runs two operating systems within a hypervisor; games run within one separate operating system, while apps and the user interface
                         run within a stripped-down version of Microsoft Windows 10. PlayStation 4 system software is the updatable firmware and operating system of the
                         PlayStation 4. The operating system is Orbis OS, based on FreeBSD 9.

Rockstar uses it to power their video games on the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, Xbox One, and PlayStation 4 consoles. It’s ability to handle large streaming worlds, complex A.I. arrangements, weather effects, fast network code and a multitude of gameplay styles made it a great fit for the development of GTA 5</li>
